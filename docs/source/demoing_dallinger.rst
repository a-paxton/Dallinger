Demoing Dallinger
===============

First, make sure you have Dallinger installed:

-  :doc:`installing_dallinger_for_users`
-  :doc:`developing_dallinger_setup_guide`

To test out Dallinger, we'll run a demo experiment in debug mode. First download the `Bartlett (1932) demo <http://dallinger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/demos/bartlett1932.html>`__ and unzip it. Then run Dallinger in debug mode from within that demo directory:

::

    dallinger debug

You will see some output as Dallinger loads. When it is finished, you will
see something that looks like:

::

    ❯❯ Server is running on 0.0.0.0:5000. Press Ctrl+C to exit.

This indicates that the server is running.

@@@ Add instructions on how to open in browser once we've done story 136.
